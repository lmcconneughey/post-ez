# Postez

A full-stack social media application for sharing posts and connecting with a community. This project was developed as a portfolio piece to demonstrate full-stack architecture, user authentication, real-time data handling, and media management.

## üöß Status Update

The **Direct Messaging** feature is currently in active development. Core functionality, including sending and viewing conversations, is now complete.

My current focus is on implementing **real-time updates** with WebSockets. This will allow new messages to instantly appear in the UI for all participants, creating a seamless chat experience.

Edit profile is up! The Edit Profile feature is up! Users can upload an avatar and cover image with crop and zoom. I'll be making improvements to this new feature.

- **Live Site**: [https://movemakersny.com](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://movemakersny.com)

- **Expected Behavior**: The live application will be available at the domain above once DNS propagation is complete.

- **Immediate Access**: For a consistent experience, you can view the live site via a direct Vercel URL. This URL is provided in the project's settings, but for security, it is not shared publicly. Please use the main domain as the primary point of access.

Thank you for your patience and understanding!
